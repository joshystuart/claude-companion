# Phase 2.4: UI Enhancements

- Remove the "Control" button from the event cards.
- Show the accept, deny, input buttons on the event card ONLY when claude requests access from the user.
  - eg
- Put the most recent event in a special call out at the top of the recent events list.
  - Then it should animate to move into the regular list when the next event comes in.
- Reduce the vertical space of the elements at the top of the page, to maximise the vertical space for the events list.
- The File Edit card should have the before and after text stacked vertically, with the before text on top.

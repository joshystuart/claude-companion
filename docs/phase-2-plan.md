# Phase 2 Implementation Plan - Claude Code Companion

## Overview
Phase 2 transforms the monitoring-only system into a full remote control platform. This adds the ability to approve/deny tool calls, inject context, and control session flow from the dashboard - the core value proposition of Claude Code Companion.

## Phase 2 Deliverables
- **Command Queue System**: Server-side queue for remote commands with real-time processing
- **Enhanced Hooks**: Decision-making capability based on remote commands
- **Remote Control Interface**: Dashboard UI for approval/denial and context injection
- **Session Control**: Pause, continue, redirect capabilities via Stop hook
- **Advanced Authentication**: Token-based agent authentication and session security

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Server Command Queue System
- Implement command queue storage (in-memory for Phase 2, database in Phase 3)
- Create command types: `approve`, `deny`, `context`, `continue`, `stop`
- Add command lifecycle management (pending → processing → completed/expired)
- Build command queue REST API endpoints for dashboard
- Update HooksService to check command queue before responding

### Step 2: Enhanced Hook Decision Logic
- Modify agent hooks to check server for pending commands before responding
- Implement timeout handling (default approve if no response in 30 seconds)
- Add command execution and response handling in hooks
- Update hook response format to handle feedback and context injection
- Test hook performance to maintain <2 second execution time

### Step 3: Dashboard Remote Control Interface  
- Build approval/denial interface with tool details and risk assessment
- Create context injection form with common templates
- Add session control panel (pause/continue/redirect)
- Implement real-time command status updates
- Design mobile-optimized control interface

### Step 4: Session Flow Control
- Enhance Stop hook to handle session continuation commands
- Implement session state management across hook calls
- Add session redirect capabilities (change working directory, switch tasks)
- Create session templates for common workflows
- Build session history and context preservation

### Step 5: Security & Authentication Enhancements
- Implement secure agent token generation and validation
- Add command authentication and authorization
- Create session isolation and access control
- Implement audit logging for all remote commands
- Add rate limiting for command execution

### Step 6: Integration & Testing
- End-to-end testing of complete remote control workflow
- Performance testing under load with multiple agents
- Security testing for authentication and authorization
- Network failure scenario testing with command queue persistence
- Mobile device testing for control interface

## Technical Implementation Details

### Command Queue Architecture
```typescript
interface RemoteCommand {
  id: string;
  agentId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  type: 'approve' | 'deny' | 'context' | 'continue' | 'stop';
  payload: {
    reason?: string;
    feedback?: string;
    instructions?: string;
  };
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'expired';
  createdAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
}
```

### Enhanced Hook Response Flow
1. Hook captures Claude's intended action
2. Hook sends event data to server 
3. Hook checks server for pending commands (GET /api/commands/{agentId})
4. If command exists: execute command, return decision to Claude
5. If no command: wait up to 30 seconds, then default approve
6. Hook marks command as completed and sends result to server

### Dashboard Control Interface
- **Real-time Event Stream**: Live view of all tool calls across agents
- **Pending Approvals**: Queue of actions awaiting approval with context
- **Quick Actions**: One-click approve/deny with customizable reasons
- **Context Injection**: Rich text editor with templates and suggestions
- **Session Control**: Pause/resume/redirect controls per agent
- **Command History**: Audit trail of all remote commands executed

### New API Endpoints
```
POST /api/commands                    # Create new remote command
GET /api/commands/:agentId            # Get pending commands for agent  
PUT /api/commands/:id/complete        # Mark command as completed
GET /api/agents/:id/session           # Get current session details
POST /api/agents/:id/session/control  # Send session control commands
```

### Enhanced Event Data Structure
```typescript
interface HookEvent {
  // ... existing fields
  data: {
    // ... existing fields
    riskLevel?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    requiresApproval?: boolean;
    suggestedAction?: string;
    context?: string[];
  };
}
```

## Key Features Added in Phase 2

### 1. Remote Approval Workflow
- **Visual Tool Preview**: See exactly what Claude wants to do before approving
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic flagging of potentially dangerous operations
- **Custom Feedback**: Provide specific instructions with approval/denial
- **Approval Templates**: Pre-configured responses for common scenarios

### 2. Context Injection System
- **Mid-Session Guidance**: Send instructions to Claude during execution
- **Context Templates**: Pre-written guidance for common situations
- **Contextual Suggestions**: AI-powered suggestions based on current tool usage
- **Persistent Context**: Context that persists across multiple tool calls

### 3. Session Control Capabilities
- **Pause/Resume**: Stop Claude execution and resume when ready
- **Task Redirection**: Change Claude's focus to different tasks
- **Session Checkpoints**: Save and restore session state
- **Multi-Session Coordination**: Coordinate work across multiple Claude instances

### 4. Advanced Dashboard Features
- **Agent Status Overview**: Real-time status of all connected agents
- **Session Timeline**: Chronological view of all actions and decisions
- **Command Queue Status**: Visibility into pending and completed commands
- **Performance Metrics**: Hook execution times and system health

## Success Criteria
- Remote approval workflow completes in <30 seconds from tool call to decision
- Context injection appears in Claude's next response within one tool cycle
- Session control commands (pause/continue) execute within 5 seconds
- Dashboard remains responsive with 10+ concurrent agents
- Hook execution time remains under 2 seconds even with command checking
- Mobile interface provides full control capability on phone/tablet

## Phase 2 Limitations (To Be Addressed in Phase 3)
- **In-Memory Storage**: Commands stored in memory, lost on server restart
- **Single User**: No multi-user collaboration or role-based access
- **Basic Templates**: Limited context templates and automation
- **No Analytics**: No session analytics or performance insights
- **Simple Auth**: Token-based auth without enterprise integration

## Next Steps After Phase 2
Phase 3 will add:
- Persistent database storage for commands and session history
- Multi-user collaboration with role-based access control
- Advanced automation and workflow templates
- Analytics dashboard with session insights
- Enterprise authentication (SSO, LDAP)
- Mobile push notifications
- Slack/Teams integration

This phase transforms Claude Code Companion from a monitoring tool into a powerful remote control system, delivering the core value proposition of controlling Claude Code sessions from anywhere.

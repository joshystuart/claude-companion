# Phase 1 Implementation Plan - Claude Code Companion

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on building the core monitoring MVP that allows remote real-time visibility into Claude Code sessions. This establishes the foundational three-package architecture and basic communication flow without remote control features.

## Phase 1 Deliverables
- **Agent Package**: NPM-installable hook installer with basic monitoring
- **Server Package**: NestJS API server with SSE streaming for real-time events  
- **Client Package**: React dashboard for real-time event visualization
- **Core Infrastructure**: Authentication, multi-agent support, monorepo setup

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Project Foundation
- Set up monorepo structure with proper package.json configurations
- Initialize three packages: `./agent`, `./server`, `./client`
- Configure build scripts and development workflow
- Set up shared dependencies and TypeScript configurations

### Step 2: Agent Package Development
- Create NPM-installable CLI tool for hook installation
- Implement Claude Code settings.json hook integration
- Build lightweight hook commands that:
  - Capture PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, Notification events
  - Send event data to server via HTTP POST
  - Handle timeouts and network failures gracefully
- Package as globally installable npm package

### Step 3: Server Package Development  
- Initialize NestJS application with proper project structure
- Implement hook event collection endpoints (POST /api/hooks/events)
- Set up Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming for real-time updates
- Build basic authentication system
- Create agent management and session tracking
- Add proper error handling and logging

### Step 4: Client Package Development
- Initialize React SPA with modern build tooling
- Create real-time event visualization dashboard
- Implement SSE client with auto-reconnection
- Build responsive UI for mobile/tablet viewing
- Add agent filtering and session management
- Create event timeline and status displays

### Step 5: Integration & Testing
- End-to-end testing of agent → server → client communication flow
- Performance testing to ensure <2 second hook execution
- Network failure and reconnection testing
- Multi-agent coordination testing
- Mobile responsive testing

### Step 6: Documentation & Packaging
- Installation and setup documentation
- Development environment setup guide
- Deployment instructions for self-hosted scenarios
- Package publishing preparation

## Key Implementation Details

### Hook Integration Strategy
The agent package will install shell command hooks in Claude Code's `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre_tool_use": "node /usr/local/lib/node_modules/claude-companion-agent/dist/hooks/pre-tool-use.js",
    "post_tool_use": "node /usr/local/lib/node_modules/claude-companion-agent/dist/hooks/post-tool-use.js", 
    "stop": "node /usr/local/lib/node_modules/claude-companion-agent/dist/hooks/stop.js",
    "notification": "node /usr/local/lib/node_modules/claude-companion-agent/dist/hooks/notification.js"
  }
}
```

### Communication Architecture
- **Agent → Server**: HTTP POST to `/api/hooks/events` with event data
- **Server → Client**: Server-Sent Events on `/api/events/stream` for real-time updates
- **Client → Server**: REST API for configuration and agent management

### Event Data Structure
```typescript
interface HookEvent {
  agentId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  hookType: 'pre_tool_use' | 'post_tool_use' | 'stop' | 'notification';
  timestamp: string;
  data: {
    toolName?: string;
    toolArgs?: any;
    result?: any;
    message?: string;
  };
}
```

### Authentication & Security
- JWT-based authentication for server API
- Agent registration with unique tokens
- CORS configuration for dashboard access
- Rate limiting on hook endpoints

## Success Criteria
- Agent installs globally and configures Claude Code hooks correctly
- Hook events stream in real-time to dashboard with <2 second latency
- Dashboard displays live tool usage across multiple agents
- System handles network disconnections gracefully
- Mobile-responsive interface works on phones/tablets
- Complete setup process takes <5 minutes

## Phase 1 Limitations (By Design)
- **No remote control**: Only monitoring, no ability to approve/deny or inject context
- **No session control**: Cannot pause/continue/redirect Claude sessions
- **Basic authentication**: Simple token-based auth, no enterprise SSO
- **Local storage only**: No persistent event history or database
- **Single dashboard**: No multi-user or team features

These limitations will be addressed in Phase 2 (Remote Control) and Phase 3 (Advanced Features).

## Next Steps After Phase 1
Once Phase 1 is complete and the monitoring foundation is solid, Phase 2 will add:
- Command queue system for remote control
- Enhanced hooks with decision-making capability
- Client interfaces for approval/denial and context injection
- Session control features (pause/continue)

This phased approach ensures we build a solid foundation before adding complexity.
